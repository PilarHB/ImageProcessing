# ImageProcessing
Image Preprocessing and Image Processing for Image Recognition

This codes uses Pytorch Lightning, Python 3.7 and Tensorboard. 

- CNN. py: Convolutional Neural Network using a Transfer Learning pretrained model. (LightningModule)
- ImageModel: Python class used for train, test and load the models. 
- MyImageModule: Class for loading our image dataset (LightningDataModule)
- ModelMetrics: Python class to load and evaluate the trained models. The metrics are saved in a directory called 'models_metrics'.
